# 🧠 Role-Based Document-Aware Chatbot (Case Study 2)

This project — developed as **Case Study 2** — focuses on building an intelligent, role-based **Document-Aware Chatbot** designed for banking and enterprise environments.  
The chatbot allows employees to quickly retrieve information from internal documents such as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), compliance manuals, and audit guidelines.

It implements **secure login and role-based access control (RBAC)** where:
- **Admins** can upload, manage, and delete documents.  
- **Users** can interact with the chatbot to ask questions and receive answers derived directly from the uploaded files.

The system supports multiple document types (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, and scanned images) and uses **AI-powered document search** to deliver accurate, cited responses — enhancing efficiency and reducing manual lookup time across organizational knowledge bases.
